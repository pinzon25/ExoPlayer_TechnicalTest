# ExoPlayer_TechnicalTest

To use the software the user must go to the main menu and select the ExoPlayer_TechnicalTest App.

When the app is executed, the software will make a request to an URL automatically, the URL is the same given at the end of the statement of the PDF document of this test.

Automatically we'll see how the video appears into the player.

At the start of the player will appear a welcome message displayed by Toast and a message that tells us that the first frame of the video is shown. 
The first frame Toast will be shown always at the start of the clip.

To pause the clip only have to push into the pause button displayed at the center of the layout. 

To Play or resume the clip have to push the play/pause button when the clip has been already paused.

To restart the clip have to push into the restart button, displayed at the left side of the rewind button.

To forward rewind only have to push the forward rewind button, displayed at the right side of the play/pause button.

To rewind only have to push the rewind button, displayed at the left side of the play/pause button.

At the bottom of the layout we'll see all the counters that show how many times we have pushed the play/pause button and the restart/repeat button, 
in addition we'll see the time passed between the paused and resumed state of the player.

When the clip finishes we'll see a end message shown by Toast telling us that the clip has finished.
